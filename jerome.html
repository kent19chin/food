              Jerome was born in segregation, and while the Jim Crow laws were abolished when he was young, the effects
              would pervade his entire life to come. His mother was 16 when he was born and so she immediately set out
              to work, earning around 50 cents a day through housekeeping. Being the eldest of seven siblings, Jerome
              was accustomed to making food stretch. For around 75 cents in the late 1960s, the Pattons would buy a big
              bag of baloney and bread and make it last for days at a time. Breakfasts growing up consisted of puffed
              wheat, oatmeal or rice with sugar. Even when they were able to afford other foods, Jerome's family would
              just gravitate to that way of eating.</p>

              Trying to buy groceries, Jerome realizes now, was deeply affected by systematic racism. "It was like our
              diets were dictated by others." Whatever meat was left to spoil was all that was available to Jerome. He
              points to moments like these as when he started to become more conscious of the influences on his diet.
              This consciousness would lead to Jerome trying to become healthier and reflect upon the root of these
              problems he faced today.

              vegetarian. And it's the temptation, it's like, at that point I'm acclimated to that stuff, to my

              and
              it was good. … anyway when the parade was over, then what I ended up doing was I tried to be a vegetarian,

              But changes to their diet is not limited to the responsibility of one individual. Environmental factors as
              well as the community as a whole need to be receptive to change and work together to realize these ideals

              a larger, fundamental level.

              Jerome’s thoughtful and charming perspective around food and culture weaved a colourful and exciting tale
              through the span of four separate interviews. His stories remained intimate and informative. It ranged
              from his experiences with being vegetarian, his food journey, alongside the lessons that he learned
              throughout the years.
              <p>
                Jerome comes from a big family, and there are various traditions that he hopes will continue to be
                passed
                down from generation to generation. He shared tidbits of information about his grandson’s eating habits
                that he wishes to be more balanced and healthier in the near future. As someone who had a positive
                experience of the vegetarian lifestyle for a brief period, Jerome hopes that his family will practice
                more
                nutritious eating habits and carry those values through time.
              </p>
              <p>
                He expressed his sorrows at not having a choice to dig deeper into his culture when he was younger, and
                remains hopeful that his culture’s food traditions will be more widespread in the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                When asked about his hopes regarding the black community and their relationship with food, he concluded
                with the statement,
              </p>
