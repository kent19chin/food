            <p>Kathie Brooks is currently working part-time as a <br> cafeteria manager in Ohio. She is a sister, a
              wife,
              <br> a mother of three and a grandmother of two.
              <br>
              Here we look at her story with food!

            <p>
              Growing up, Kathie learned how to cook from her parents and they would encourage her and her sister to
              help
              out. They would start off doing smaller tasks, like cleaning up in the kitchen and making breakfast.
              <br> <br>
              Her father was also the one who introduced Kathie to cooking soul foods.
              <br> <br>
              “Soul food is the best! It brings the family together and we look forward to it. The food is very
              comforting.”
              <br> <br>
              Kathie would also teach her kids how to cook in a similar way.
              <br>
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
              “He [Kathie’s son] always wanted to be in the kitchen. If I was making a cake he got to stir, or if we
              were
              making cookies he got to stir or pour things in and to this day he’s a very good baker.” </p>

          <div class="col-8 past_words">
            <p>
              Now that her kids are more grown-up, Kathie would get them to plan a meal once a week for the family. When
              asked about her children’s eating habits, she responded,
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
              “My son, he’s a weightlifter. He really watches how he eats. My daughter, the oldest one with the two
              grandkids, she’s very good about cooking. But they try a lot of things, like this Thanksgiving they’re
              going
              to try a fried turkey. For the most part, they eat really well. She and her husband do a lot of fasting.
              And
              they eat a lot of smoothies. My youngest daughter’s the same - she eats healthy but she doesn’t eat
              regularly. ”

            <p>
              As Kathie grew up, discussions about heart disease and diabetes became more prominent. These topics
              weren’t
              brought up in her childhood as nobody had them when she was younger, but she soon learned that these
              health
              concerns affected her family. This impacted her food choices and cooking methods.</p>
            <p class="highlight">
              “The biggest issue [with soul food] is that you cook with a lot of fat. There are a lot of fried foods
              that
              are rich in sodium, but it doesn’t have to be like this! I use olive oil instead of lard, and things that
              are lighter in oil. Not so much fried [foods], more braised food or baked.”
            </p>
            <p>
              When asked about balancing her health and keeping soul foods authentic, she responded,
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
              “Modification can affect authenticity in a way. If you want to be healthier, you got to do it. Authentic
              soul food has too much fat and sodium, so you would have to give up some of that. It’s more about refining
              rather than defining soul food.”</p>

            <p class="present_caption">Food plays a decently important role in Kathie’s life. She would have pot luck
              with her
              kids and family
              where everybody would bring their own food and drink to the gathering. </p>

              Kathie plans to continue incorporating healthier cooking into her lifestyle. She tries to buy more organic
              foods, cut down on portion sizes, and continue cooking soul foods with healthier alternatives that are
              lighter in fat, sodium, and sugar.
              Her husband already doesn’t eat red meat. Kathie calls him a pescatarian because of how much seafood he
              eats, but he has helped her cut down on her red meat consumption as well!
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
              “I don’t eat hardly as much red meat as I used to and I’ve noticed the difference. For our future, we are
              really watching what we eat. I keep telling him he needs to cut down the processed food.

              When asked about what she hopes younger generations can take away from all of this in regards to food, she
              said,
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
              “Eat sensibly. Eat for your health. I don’t live to eat, I eat to live.”</p>
